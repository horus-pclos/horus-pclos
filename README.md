- 👋 Hi, I’m @horus-pclos
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, (specifically PCLinuxOS), Gambas, emulation technologies, retro-computing, CP/M, MS-DOS, and I play bass guitar.  I also enjoy the occasional tabletop role-playing game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RFO-BASIC for Android, Gambas, BASH Scripting, and generally everything I can about computing and retro and faux-retro computing.
- 💞️ Not really looking to collaborate just yet - very new here and want to learn more first.
- 📫 I can be reached at horus@netdoor.com
